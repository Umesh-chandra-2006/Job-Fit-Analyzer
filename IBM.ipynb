        "    *   Select option `1` when prompted in the main menu.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Run Interactive Analysis:** This option allows you to paste your own resume and a job description for a personalized analysis. The assistant will then evaluate the fit and provide detailed feedback.\n",
        "    *   Select option `2` when prompted in the main menu.\n",
        "    *   You will be asked to paste your resume text and then the job description text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **General Resume Improvements:** (Requires manual call for now, will be integrated into main menu later)\n",
        "    *   You can call `generate_resume_improvements(your_resume_text)` with your resume.\n",
        "    *   Then, `display_resume_improvements(suggestions)` to see general suggestions.\n",

        "2.  **Interactive Job Fit Analysis:**\n",
        "    *   Run the interactive analysis (Option 2 in main menu).\n",
        "    *   Provide sample resume and job description texts (ensure they meet the minimum length requirement).\n",

        "3.  **API Key Configuration Error Handling:**\n",
        "    *   (Optional: Temporarily remove or invalidate the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from Colab secrets if testing this scenario.)\n",
        "    *   Run any analysis function (demo or interactive).\n",
        "    *   Verify that an `API Configuration Error` message is displayed, indicating the missing API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **JSON Response Parsing Error Handling:**\n",
        "    *   (Difficult to test directly without modifying the model's output, but ensure the `analyze_job_fit` function includes `json.JSONDecodeError` handling).\n",
        "    *   If the AI model were to return non-JSON, ensure an error message related to invalid JSON is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **General Resume Improvements (Manual Call):**\n",
        "    *   Execute the `generate_resume_improvements` function with a sample resume.\n",
        "    *   Verify that the `display_resume_improvements` function presents a list of general suggestions for resume enhancement.\n",

            "   • Generic Summary Statement: The 'Summary' section is functional but lacks specific impact, a unique value proposition, or tailored career objectives, making it less compelling.\n",
            "   • Inconsistent Quantification: While some achievements are quantified, other significant responsibilities (e.g., 'Designed and implemented data pipelines') lack specific details on scope, scale, or measurable impact.\n",

            "   • Enhance Visual Hierarchy: Use distinct font sizes or bolding for section titles and job titles to improve scannability and draw immediate attention to key information.\n",
            "   • Increase White Space: Add more vertical spacing between sections and potentially between bullet points to prevent the text from appearing dense and significantly improve overall readability.\n",
            "   • Modern Font Choice: Consider using a modern, professional sans-serif font (e.g., Calibri, Lato, Montserrat, Open Sans) to give the resume a fresh, polished, and contemporary aesthetic without sacrificing legibility.\n",

            "   • Strengthen the Summary: Rewrite the 'Summary' to be more impactful by including a specific career goal, a unique selling proposition, or a key overarching achievement from the past 5 years.\n",
            "   • Quantify All Achievements: Review every bullet point in the 'Experience' section and add metrics, scale, or tangible outcomes wherever possible (e.g., 'Implemented data pipelines processing X TB/day on AWS, reducing manual effort by Y%').\n",
            "   • Focus on Impact and Results: For each experience bullet, frame the description around the problem solved, the actions taken, and the positive outcomes, consistently using the Challenge-Action-Result (CAR) framework.\n",
